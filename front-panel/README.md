## This is the design and the engraving files for my wood panel for the Altair8800
The nc files in the sample directory are for a 2.5W GRBL based laser cutter. They are meant for 3mm plywood.  
  
The SketchUp file includes the models for all the cut and engraving parts, as well as the model for the fake LED.
